function extractFeaturesLarvae(inputArg1,inputArg2)

    %Proportion of larvae going to odor and scatter polar.
    
    %Agility to turn around to head odor. Agility to turn around any
    %direction
    
    %Speed towards odor. General speed / covered distance. Max speed. Speed
    %No odor gradient. (speed / polar histogram)
    

    %Rate X/Y axis trajectory

%     To quantify the overall navigational response in the linear spatial
%     gradient, we computed a navigation index by dividing the mean
%     velocity of all larvae in the x-direction by the mean crawling speed.
%     Hence, the navigational index was +/−1 if the larvae crawled
%     uniformly straight up/down the gradient and 0 if the movement was
%     unbiased. For each bout and at each time point, the position of the
%     larva relative to the odor gradient was estimated as well as its
%     likelihood to be engaged in a turn (details in Gershow et al., 2012).
%     To quantify turn-based navigation strategy, we compared the turn
%     probability when the larvae were aligned towards the gradient (±15
%     degrees) to the turn probability when the larvae were aligned away
%     from the gradient (±15 degrees). The experiments were repeated 7–10
%     times in each condition. The mean and s.e.m. of these parameters were
%     computed for each experiment and further pooled for the repeats. A
%     Welch z test was used for statistical comparisons.
