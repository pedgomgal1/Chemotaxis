%Protocol

%First, we evaluated whether features values of 2 kind of data presented normal 
%distribution and variance using Kolmogorov–Smirnov and F?Snedecor tests, respectively. 
%In case that data presented normal distribution but not an equal variance,
%we employed a two?tailed Welch test to compare the means from both groups. 
%In case that data presented not normal distribution, 
%we employed Wilcoxon test to compare the medians from both groups. 
%We employed a two?tailed Student's t ?test to compare the means in the cases
%where both distribution and variance of the two sets of data were similar
